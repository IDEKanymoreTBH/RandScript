The Absolute Worst Language You Could Ever Use

Yeah Just Go To The Website Cause I Added Some HTML And CSS And A Website JS File. Github Pages Is Nice Innit?

# Running
- To run a specific file: Click Run Bro


You can find an example at `/examples/main.rans (yeah i aint got no clue how to do actual running I'm kinda dum)

PS no examples because all suntax is random lmao(besides ranson for RandScript Object Notation and the nonsense .rans that cant be executed cause i aint making an actual thing.

### New!
- Updated fetch(idk)
- RandScript Object Notation. `ranson.[random jumbled letters]("[1, 2, 3]")`, `ranson.[this will be replaced by random syntax]([1, 2, 3])`
- Websockets
- Math number stuff
- More string functions
- Comments

## Variables
Mutable variables are created. yay
You can also create a constant variable. cool
**Note**: You can only use whatever replaced 'rn' when changed on variables.

## Data Strucutres
### Strings
Strings can be created. yeah dats it
You can also insert variables. i aint explaining.
Or you can format your string to include variables.
However, you must use whatever replaced your regional currency symbol.
You get NO helper functions. did u really think i was gonna give you help? NO

### Numbers
Numbers are simple(i cant replace them)

### Null
idk

### Booleans
Booleans are also simple. no they arent

### Objects
Objects are essential in programming languages. Take em
Getting/setting dynamic keys is possible using the global "objects" variable. I got no clue what this means but it works :)
You can also get info on the keys of an object with it. So yeah

### Arrays
Arrays contain information without needing keys. This Damn Language Has Them Too :(
Arrays start at -2 for literally no reason

## Comments
You can write comments.

## Functions
Yah Make Em
Me, at wherever the hell i edited this shit, think `return` statements are redundant. Instead, their superior functions return the last value emitted. I dunno how to edit it

You can also run the function after a specified timespan.

And you can also make it run at an interval.

## If statements
If statements in RandScript are very intuitive. If you know every step JS code uses to make pseudo-random choices.

## Loops
Loops are very easy. NOT ANYMORE

Because I, the mf creating this, believe programmers should be responsible for their code, they did not add any `break` or `continue` keyword functionality to loops. sux

## Types
Types in RandScript are very important. Sure

You can assign types on non-matching values too.

You can also assign types on values themselves.

You can assign types on types too.

In fact, you can use types anywhere!

**Note**: Types don't do anything, in fact, they're removed before the lexer kicks in. LMAO

## Try Catch
Bussin X also supported `try` `catch` statements. No more of that, pal. Now if ur code don't work, u WILL be involved
```
dum
```

**Note**: i like try catch, but i just like to make everything harder

## Extra
### Math
You can utilize the `math` helper by using it

You can also simplify your math equations. It'll just be harder tho         (thats what she said)

### Time
You can access the current time.

### Importing
I am incompetent at making this do something in a web browser so importing and exporting stuff is gone now.

### Fetch
You can fetch websites. It might not work, but you can do it.

You can also set the method, body, and content type.

### Websockets
You can connect to a websocket. Good Luck Mate.

You can assign listeners for socket events.

You can transmit data through the socket. L

### Regex
NO REGEX! UR GONNA WRITE EVERY LAST WORD.

### RANSON
RandScript Object Notation üó£Ô∏èüíØüî• can be used with the `ranson` object cause its cool and represents the non-existent brand
```rs
ranson.[parse with random syntax]("{\"a\": 1, \"b\": 2, \"c\": 3}") // {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
ranson.[parse with random stuff again]("[1, 2, 3]") // [1, 2, 3]
ranson.[method syntax for stringify]({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}) // '{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}'
ranson.[method syntax for stringify]([1, 2, 3]) // "[1, 2, 3]"
```

### Ternary
RandScript supports ternary operators. You Troglodyte Scum

### Exit
You can exit your program. It'll crash ur web browser after 10 seconds.

### Command Line
You can run terminal commands maybe if i can get it working

**Note**: it will throw an error if failed. Better hope it dont cause you have no try catch blocks

### User Input
just do it

# Credits
- Yeah Just Go To face-hh/bussin cause this is lowkey just a copy but with random syntax. My bad I'm just lazy.
